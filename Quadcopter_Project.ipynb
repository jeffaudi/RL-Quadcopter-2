    "My task is to take-off from ground and reach 30 m. I decided to start at 10 m. in order to let the agent some time to learn as the episode stops when quadcopter reaches ground (or exit space). I have constructed my reward function with the following parameters:\n",
    "1. Do not crash: I give a positive reward of +1 for each steps where the copter stays in the air (at first, it mostly seemed to crash all the time). I did not add a function to stop the episode when the copter reaches a target heigth so I want to encourage it to stay in the air until the episode ends (after 5 min. max.) \n",

    "I have tested the implementation by switching off noise and setting both max and min rotor speed to the same value. Rotor speed of 400 rpm was not enough to stay in the air and 410 rpm was just enough to go up. Since the copter should avoid falling to the ground and move up to 30 m., its rotor speed should be somewhat greater than  410 rpm.  This seemed to be the target value that I want our model to learn. So, in order to reduce the action space, I have set the minimum rotor speed to 350 rpm and maximum to 700 rpm. \n",

Currently, the copter tries to find a speed that brings it around 30 m. at the end of the time limit (i.e. 5 sec.).\n"

I assumed that this issue was due to trying to learn the 4 different speeds for the 4 rotors at once. Since I did not needed the copter to move along the X or Y axis, I modified the task and the model to predict a single speed that I applied to all rotors simultaneously.\n",

Then I realized that ReLu and LeakyReLu were maybe not suited for continuous functions modelization and replaced all of them by simple sigmoids. And suddenly the model performed much better.\n",

I increased the value for sigma in the noise to 1.0 as I felt 0.2 change in rpm was not enough to explore (but more noise prevents the agent from learning correctly). I kept gamma and tau as already setup in the templates (and compatible with the paper). I also decreased the learning rate of the Adam optimizers to 0.001 to make sure that it will move slowly enough to keep both models stable. "

In that case, there is a aha moment when the reward increase dramatically when the agent stopped making the copter fall to the ground.

As the reward is symetric below and above the 30 m. threshold, the agent almost always overshoot the target (because nothing tells him it should not). I have quickly tried to add an asymetric reward for overshooting 30 m. (bigger penalty for Z over 30 m.). But this seems to make the agent hesitate more and makes globally the learning process more bumpy. So I decided to stick with my goal of taking off.\n",
